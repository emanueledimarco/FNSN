\section{Particle Detectors}
The main purpose of particle detectors is to detect particles and to measure their properties, such as:
\begin{itemize}
\item trajectory in space and time;
\item charge and momentum;
\item deposited energy when interacting with matter.
\end{itemize}
These three properties are well known and constitute a well-motivated way to discriminate between (``identify'') particles.

The detection process is strictly related to the way particles interact in the material of which the detector is composed. The energy of the particle is transferred to the medium and undergoes a process of \emph{conversion} into another form which can be detected.

\subsection{Detectors of charged particles}\label{sec:detector1}
It is possible to identify, between the various processes which are today used in particle detectors, four main processes -- and, correspondingly, four different kinds of detectors:
\begin{itemize}
\item ionisation detectors;
\item scintillation detectors;
\item semiconductors;
\item Cherenkov detectors.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Ionisation detectors}
In a gaseous medium, ionisation corresponds to the creation of electron--ion (or electron--nucleus) pairs along the path of a particle which crosses its material. The minimum energy to create a pair is $\sim 20\div30\,\electronvolt$.

The ionisation can be measured in many different ways. One simple method consist in applying a very strong electric field to observe a discharge when a charged particle crosses the medium. This is the principle on which the \emph{Geiger--Muller counter} is based (1913).

\begin{figure}
  \centering \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{detector5}
  \caption{After a charged particle has crossed the detector, a discharge is observed.}
  \label{fig:detector5}
\end{figure}

Electrons produced in the ionisation are immediately accelerated by the electric field, originating further (``secondary'') ionisations which start an avalanche process (\emph{Townsend avalanche}).

\begin{figure}
  \centering \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{detector4}
  \caption{Example of an avalanche process originated after the primary ionisation using an electric field $E$.}
  \label{fig:detector4}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Scintillation detectors}
If a charged particle crosses a solid (or liquid) medium, the energy is first transferred to the atoms and then released in form of light. This emission is at the origin of the term \emph{scintillator}.

The first particle physics experiments were based on phosphorescent screens, which can be seen as primitive scintillators.

Modern experiments typically measure this light emission with a \emph{photomultiplier}, which is based on the emission of electrons in a photocatode (a cathode covered with a material which can expel electrons via photoelectric effect). Electrons in the photomultiplier are then accelerated and collected in electrodes which emit secondary electrons, amplifying the signal which can be collected and measured.

\subsubsection*{Semiconductors}
In an inversely-polarised junction of a semiconductor, the ionisation left by a particle leads to the creation of an electron--hole pair which is collected by the two terms of the junction and can be measured as a small electrical signal. The measure obtained by detectors based on semiconductors can be extremely precise.

\subsubsection*{Cherenkov detectors}
Cherenkov radiation is emitted by the polarised medium which is crossed by a particle travelling faster than the speed of light in that medium. This light can be detected, measuring also the angle of emission and the intensity to obtain informations on the particle.


\subsection{The first detectors}
The electrometer of T. Wulf (figure \ref{fig:detector1}) was introduced in 1909. It allows to detect the ionisation using two gold leafs which are able to move. As charge is released on the electrometer by ionisation (or by electrostatic induction), the two leafs repels themselves and, measuring the angle in between, it is possible to obtain the amount of charge left on them.

The experiments made by D. Pacini were based on this electrometer. Pacini measured the ionisation rate under $3\,\meter$ of water.
In 1912 V. Hess installed the electrometer on a balloon and measured the rate of detected particles at $5300\,\meter$ above the sea level. He observed four times the rate which was measured at ground level. This experiment brought him to the discovery of \emph{cosmic rays}, for which he received the Nobel prize in 1936.

Another type of detector, widely used in the experiments which led to the discovery of many fundamental particles, is the \emph{Cloud chamber} introduced by Wilson (Fig. \ref{fig:cloudchamber}). It is a closed vessel in which a cold plate ($T\sim-20\,\celsius$) and a liquid solvent (e.g. ethanol) are present; the solvent is kept around its boiling point in a meta--stable liquid--gaseous state. A particle which crosses this chamber creates an ionisation track, due to the voltage applied, around which the alcohol condensates, producing small condensation drops which can be seen or photographed.
\begin{figure}

    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{Contents/cloudchamber.jpg}
    \caption{Illustration of the cloud chamber created by Wilson.
    Particles leave different tracks which help to identify them.}
    \label{fig:cloudchamber}
\end{figure}

Ionisation can be also detected via \emph{photographic emulsions}, in a very similar way as photos are captured. Usually a gelatin containing photo--sensible crystals (like $\text{AgB}_2$) is used: once exposed to light, these crystals can be detected using common photographic processing techniques. In the case of ionising particles, the track can be detected with high precision.

This kind of detection technique (which takes the name of \emph{nuclear emulsion}) has been developed by Powell in 1939 and has been used recently in neutrino experiments like Chorus and Opera.

The \emph{bubble chamber} was introduced in 1952 by Glaser and is based on the same principle as cloud chambers. In this case a super--heated liquid (brought under pressure at a temperature above its boiling point) is used. When a particle crosses the chamber, the pressure is decreased with a piston and the ionisation induces the formation of small bubbles, which can be photographed. The main improvement with respect to the Wilson's cloud chamber is the possibility of making these vessels very large to allow a precise three--dimensional reconstruction.

\begin{figure}

  \caption{Left: scheme of a bubble chamber. Right: $2\,\meter$ bubble chamber at CERN.}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Measurements on particle tracks}
Charged particle detectors allow to measure and identify particles; for example:
\begin{itemize}
\item the amount of ionisation that the particle leaves in the
  material gives information on its velocity $\beta c$;
\item some information on particle momentum can be extracted from multiple scattering.
\end{itemize}

Many additional information, and a precise measurement of momentum can
be extracted from a precise measurement of the particle track. In
particular, by having a charged particle travel through a region with a known magnetic field it is possible to extract
information on its charge and momentum from the curvature of
the particle track.

A particle with charge $q$ and mass $m$, which moves with velocity
$\vec{v}$ in a constant magnetic field $\vec{B}$ is affected by the
Lorentz force
\[\vec{F} = q\vec{v}\times\vec{B}\]
Let's study the motion of a particle in the plane orthogonal to
$\vec{B}$ (see figure \ref{fig:detector7}).

\begin{figure}
  \centering \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{detector7}
  \caption{Illustration of the geometry of a tracking detector immersed in a magnetic field. The particle curvature is described by the curvature radius $\rho$, which can be deduced for example from a measurement of the sagitta $s$.}
  \label{fig:detector7}
\end{figure}

We can write
\begin{eqnarray*}
  m\frac{v^2}{\rho}&=&qvb,\\
  mv &=& qB\rho
\end{eqnarray*}
which gives
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:detector1}
  p = qB\rho.
\end{equation}
It is useful to express this equation in the following way (assuming $q = e$, using tesla and meters for $B$ and $\rho$, respectively):
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:detector3}
  p\,\qq{\giga\electronvolt} = 0.3\,q\,\qq{C} \,B\,\qq{\tesla}\ \rho\,\qq{\meter}.
\end{equation}
This formula can be obtained by multiplying both
members of \ref{eq:detector1} by $c$ and using natural units.

Let's now consider again figure \ref{fig:detector7}, and assume that we measure the track of the particle in the region where the magnetic field acts. We can write
\begin{eqnarray*}
  \rho^2 &=& \rr{\frac{R}{2}}^2 + \rr{R-s}^2\\
         &=& \frac{R^2}{4} + \rho^2 + s^2 -2\rho s,\\
  s^2 -2\rho s &=& - \frac{R^2}{4},\\
\end{eqnarray*}
and in the limit of very small $s$ we can neglect the term proportional to $s^2$, and obtain
\[s = \frac{R^2}{8\rho}.\]
Using Eq. \eqref{eq:detector3} we get
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:detector2}
  s = \frac{0.3\,B R^2}{8p},
\end{equation}
which finally gives:
\[p = \frac{0.3\,B R^2}{8s}.\]

It is clear that the accuracy on momentum measurement, assuming $B$ to be stationary and well known, depends on the measurement of $R$ and $s$. Considering only the uncertainty on $s$, the uncertainty on momentum $\Delta p$ can be written ads
\begin{eqnarray*}
  \Delta p &=& \frac{0.3\,BR^2}{8}\left|\dpar{\frac{1}{s}}{s}\right|\Delta s\\
          &=&\frac{0.3\,BR^2}{8s^2}\Delta s\\
           &=& \frac{0.3\,BR^2}{8}\rr{\frac{8p}{0.3\,BR^2}}^2 \Delta s\\
           &=& \frac{8p^2}{0.3\,BR^2}\Delta s,
\end{eqnarray*}
in which we used equation \ref{eq:detector2}. This can be written as
\[\frac{\Delta p }{p^2} = \frac{8}{0.3\,BR^2}\Delta s\]

Since the resolution on position measurement, and then on $s$ is constant, we get that:
\[\frac{\Delta p}{p} \propto p\]
This means that the resolution on the momentum measurement is directly proportional to the momentum itself.

Another typical case is the one of the magnetic analyser, shown in figure \ref{fig:detector8}. In this case, we measure the track of the particle before and after it gets deflected by a magnetic field.

\begin{figure}
  \centering \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{detector8}
  \caption{Illustration of a magnetic analyser. We measure the track of the particle before and after the region where the magnetic field is present, i.e. we effectively measure the vertical displacement $x$ -- or, equivalently, the angle $\theta$ between the initial and final directions of the particle.}
  \label{fig:detector8}
\end{figure}

From the figure it's easy to get
\[\frac{\frac{R}{2}}{\rho} = \sin\frac{\theta}{2},\]
which for small angles becomes
\begin{eqnarray*}
  \frac{\frac{R}{2}}{\rho} &\sim& \frac{\theta}{2}\\
  R &\sim& \rho \theta,
\end{eqnarray*}
and using Eq. \eqref{eq:detector3}, in natural units, we have
\begin{eqnarray*}
  p &=& 0.3\, B\rho\\
    &=& 0.3\,B\frac{R}{\theta},\\
  p\theta &=& 0.3\,BR,
\end{eqnarray*}
i.e.
\[\theta = 0.3\,B\frac{R}{p}.\]
Since the displacement $x$ can be expressed as
\begin{eqnarray*}
  x &=& R\sin\frac{\theta}{2}\\
    &\simeq& R\frac{\theta}{2}  \\
  &=& \frac{0.3\,BR^2}{2p},
\end{eqnarray*}
i.e.
\[p = \frac{0.3\,BR^2}{2x},\]
as before we get
\[\Delta p = \frac{0.3\,BR^2}{2x^2}\Delta x,\]
and the resolution on $p$ is
\[\frac{\Delta p}{p^2} = \frac{2}{0.3\,BR^2}\Delta x.\]
Again, the resolution on momentum is proportional to the momentum itself since $\Delta x$ can be treated as a constant.


\subsubsection*{Key points}
\begin{itemize}
\item In order to reconstruct particle tracks, a strong magnetic field is required. High--momentum tracks need intense magnetic fields to be detectable.
\item There's a wide variety of detectors suitable for tracking (the one listed here are just few examples).
\item Some detectors can measure the velocity of the particle, or the ionisation released, or the transition radiation emitted.
\item The precision on the momentum measurement is strictly related to the precision on the position of the track points.
\item The choice of which kind of detector to use is strongly dependent on the volume which needs to be covered, the resolution or the rapidity of the emitted signal (some detectors with a very fast response are used as trigger).
